Match - Shovel Problem

There are four matches placed in a grid in such way that the shape represents a shovel. Inside the shovel there is a trash. The goal of the game is to reform the shovel in such way that it does not include the trash. The player is allowed to use only two moves.

Example:

State 1:
   ****
**** &
   ****
   
State 2:
    ***
**** &
   ****
   *
   
State 3:
